The aim of this project was to research and develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of a late delivery. 
I used the DataCo Supply chain dataset available on Kaggle to employ the usage of any three classification methods in python on the dataset and the classification methods used were: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier. 
The systematic approach carried included data processing and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation for model building, model development, model optimization and conclusion
