# Project Aim:
The aim of this project was to research and develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of a late delivery. I used the DataCo Supply chain dataset available on Kaggle to employ the usage of any three classification methods in python on the dataset and the classification methods used were: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier. 
The systematic approach carried included data processing and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation for model building, model development, model optimization and conclusion

# Methodology:
I adopted the KDD (Knowledge Discovery Database) Methodologies which is an iterative process that transforms raw data into useful information. Different steps involved in the KDD Methodology are:
- Data Collection
- Pre-processing and exploring the data
-	Data Preparation
-	Model Training
-	Evaluating Model Performance
-	Improving Model Performance

# Data Collection:

In this process, I sourced for the data source to be used for our case study whose link is shown below:
Dataset link: [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5)

This is the dataset of Supply Chains used by the company DataCo Global which includes a collection of their products sold, financial details (profit, loss, total sales etc.), Shipping details, and customer details such as sales, demographics, and transaction details.
